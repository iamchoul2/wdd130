        <p>
            Virtual piano can be played anywhere and you can also plug in headphones to the device you're using to play silently to
             yourself it also makes it easier for those with disabilities because of how compact the piano becomes. The piano takes the
             layout of the QWERTY keyboard so most people will already know how to use it. There is also the re-binding feature that
             allows you to change the positions of keys to better suit you. Virtual piano and regular piano can be used as a way to
             relieve stress it is very theraputic and very easy to learn. Also if you find it too hard to learn regular piano 
             virtual piano is very easy to use. The sheets don't use any of the regular sheets. It has its own which uses the 
             letters of the alphabet to show you how to play. This allows easier access to playing and makes it easier to integrate
             music into your life.

                Virtual piano is also not just for those who are new to piano there are many uses for advanced pianists to use it. 
                Pianists can use this website/app to help others learn piano and experienced pianos can get money out of it as well.
                 Experienced pianists can also work with other experienced pianists to make music live with each other. On one of the
                  virtual piano websites, there is a built-in very intuitive chat system.

            <p>
                There are many virtual piano competitions where people from around the world compete against each other and show off 
                the skills they possess to earn prizes or just compete for the experience of playing for hundreds if not thousands of
                 people. These competitions help people become more comfortable with playing for audiences and it also helps them 
                 improve their skills immensely. Some virtual piano websites have many people willing to teach and a bunch of pre-made 
                 lessons that will help to teach you.
