      <p> Virtual Piano is an amazing tool for people of all ages to use. it has many uses like composing, learning, and collaborative music making, 
        gives accessibility to those with disabilities, and even can be used for live performances. One thing that is also great is that
        it is very accessible and portable. It is always at your fingertips and you can play anywhere by just plugging headphones in. 
      </p>
      <p>Something very versatile is the composition and the recording. You can easily make music and instantly test how it sounds using virtual 
        piano and you can also change it on the fly if you are advanced enough. It also has a MIDI integration feature so if you are ever at home
        with your piano and still want to use the website/app to use the easily accessible composing tool you can just hook your keyboard up.
        Not only is it versatile but it is also free so it is very cost-effective if you do not have much money to spend. there are also so many 
        different websites that all host virtual piano. Some are better than others. Virtualpiano.net and pianorhytmn.io are my two favorite websites
        to use to play virtual piano
      </p>
      <p>Virtual piano can be played anywhere and you can also plug in headphones to the device you're using to play silently to yourself it also makes it easier
        for those with disabilities because of how compact the piano becomes. The piano takes the layout of the QWERTY keyboard so most people
        will already know how to use it. There is also the re-binding feature that allows you to change the positions of keys to better suit
        you. Virtual piano and regular piano can be used as a way to relieve stress it is very theraputic and very easy to learn. Also if you find it too hard to learn regular piano virtual piano
        is very easy to use. The sheets don't use any of the regular sheets. It has its own which uses the letters of the alphabet to show
        you how to play. This allows easier access to playing and makes it easier to integrate music into your life.
      </p>
      <p>Virtual piano has a wide array of instruments all accessible at your fingertips. you aren't just limited to playing just one type of piano or one type of instrument.
        There are a wide variety of instruments you can use. Like for instance the drums, guitar, Electric guitar, and many others. Virtual Piano
        gives the opportunity to play an instrument to those who either can't afford a physical piano or aren't able to store it anywhere. 
      </p>
      <p>There are many virtual piano competitions where people from around the world compete against each other and show off the skills they
        possess to earn prizes or just compete for the experience of playing for hundreds if not thousands of people. These competitions help people 
        become more comfortable with playing for audiences and it also helps them improve their skills immensely. Some virtual piano websites have 
        many people willing to teach and a bunch of pre-made lessons that will help to teach you.
      </p>
      <p>Virtual piano is also not just for those who are new to piano there are many uses for advanced pianists to use it. Pianists can use 
        this website/app to help others learn piano and experienced pianos can get money out of it as well. Experienced pianists can also work with
        other experienced pianists to make music live with each other. On one of the virtual piano websites, there is a built-in very intuitive chat system.
