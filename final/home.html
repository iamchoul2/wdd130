                    Virtual piano is also not just for those who are new to piano there are many uses for advanced pianists to use it. 
                    Pianists can use this website/app to help others learn piano and experienced pianos can get money out of it as 
                    well. Experienced pianists can also work with other experienced pianists to make music live with each other.
